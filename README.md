It uses Net::LDAP(3) to do all LDAP related stuff and Template(3) to generate files. Config file is processed with Config::Parser(3) (it's format described in Regather::Config(3)

regather has plugin structure and allows to perform any desired action, based on event data

* configfile
* nsupdate
* script

As example, regather, on LDAP event can
* create/re-write/delete OpenVPN client config file/s
* create/re-write/delete CRL file for OpenVPN or FreeRADIUS (in this case it is ca+crl pem file)
* create/re-write/delete sieve script for mail user.
* nsupdate DNS zones
